<h3 class="section">E.2 Packets</h3>

<p>The following table provides a complete list of all currently defined
<var>command</var>s and their corresponding response <var>data</var>. 
See <a href="File_002dI_002fO-Remote-Protocol-Extension.html#File_002dI_002fO-Remote-Protocol-Extension">File-I/O Remote Protocol Extension</a>, for details about the File
I/O extension of the remote protocol.

   <p>Each packet's description has a template showing the packet's overall
syntax, followed by an explanation of the packet's meaning.  We
include spaces in some of the templates for clarity; these are not
part of the packet's syntax.  No <span class="sc">gdb</span> packet uses spaces to
separate its components.  For example, a template like `<samp><span class="samp">foo
</span><var>bar</var> <var>baz</var></samp>' describes a packet beginning with the three ASCII
bytes `<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>', followed by a <var>bar</var>, followed directly by a
<var>baz</var>.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> does not transmit a space character between the
`<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>' and the <var>bar</var>, or between the <var>bar</var> and the
<var>baz</var>.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040var_007bthread_002did_007d_002c-in-remote-protocol-2641"></a><a name="thread_002did-syntax"></a>
Several packets and replies include a <var>thread-id</var> field to identify
a thread.  Normally these are positive numbers with a target-specific
interpretation, formatted as big-endian hex strings.  A <var>thread-id</var>
can also be a literal `<samp><span class="samp">-1</span></samp>' to indicate all threads, or `<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>' to
pick any thread.

   <p>In addition, the remote protocol supports a multiprocess feature in
which the <var>thread-id</var> syntax is extended to optionally include both
process and thread ID fields, as `<samp><span class="samp">p</span><var>pid</var><span class="samp">.</span><var>tid</var></samp>'. 
The <var>pid</var> (process) and <var>tid</var> (thread) components each have the
format described above: a positive number with target-specific
interpretation formatted as a big-endian hex string, literal `<samp><span class="samp">-1</span></samp>'
to indicate all processes or threads (respectively), or `<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>' to
indicate an arbitrary process or thread.  Specifying just a process, as
`<samp><span class="samp">p</span><var>pid</var></samp>', is equivalent to `<samp><span class="samp">p</span><var>pid</var><span class="samp">.-1</span></samp>'.  It is an
error to specify all processes but a specific thread, such as
`<samp><span class="samp">p-1.</span><var>tid</var></samp>'.  Note that the `<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>' prefix is <em>not</em> used
for those packets and replies explicitly documented to include a process
ID, rather than a <var>thread-id</var>.

   <p>The multiprocess <var>thread-id</var> syntax extensions are only used if both
<span class="sc">gdb</span> and the stub report support for the `<samp><span class="samp">multiprocess</span></samp>'
feature using `<samp><span class="samp">qSupported</span></samp>'.  See <a href="multiprocess-extensions.html#multiprocess-extensions">multiprocess extensions</a>, for
more information.

   <p>Note that all packet forms beginning with an upper- or lower-case
letter, other than those described here, are reserved for future use.

   <p>Here are the packet descriptions.

<dt>`<samp><var>XX<small class="dots">...</small></var></samp>'<dd>Each byte of register data is described by two hex digits.  The bytes
with the register are transmitted in target byte order.  The size of
each register and their position within the `<samp><span class="samp">g</span></samp>' packet are
determined by the <span class="sc">gdb</span> internal gdbarch functions
<code>DEPRECATED_REGISTER_RAW_SIZE</code> and <code>gdbarch_register_name</code>.  The
specification of several standard `<samp><span class="samp">g</span></samp>' packets is specified below.

          <p>When reading registers from a trace frame (see <a href="Analyze-Collected-Data.html#Analyze-Collected-Data">Using the Collected Data</a>), the stub may also return a string of
literal `<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>''s in place of the register data digits, to indicate
that the corresponding register has not been collected, thus its value
is unavailable.  For example, for an architecture with 4 registers of
4 bytes each, the following reply indicates to <span class="sc">gdb</span> that
registers 0 and 2 have not been collected, while registers 1 and 3
have been collected, and both have zero value:

Resume the inferior, specifying different actions for each thread. 
If an action is specified with no <var>thread-id</var>, then it is applied to any
threads that don't have a specific action specified; if no default action is
specified then other threads should remain stopped in all-stop mode and
in their current state in non-stop mode. 
Specifying multiple
default actions is an error; specifying no actions is also an error. 
Thread IDs are specified using the syntax described in <a href="thread_002did-syntax.html#thread_002did-syntax">thread-id syntax</a>.

     <p>Currently supported actions are:

          <dl>

<br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">C </span><var>sig</var></samp>'<dd>Continue with signal <var>sig</var>.  The signal <var>sig</var> should be two hex digits.

not supported in `<samp><span class="samp">vCont</span></samp>'.

     <p>The `<samp><span class="samp">t</span></samp>' action is only relevant in non-stop mode
(see <a href="Remote-Non_002dStop.html#Remote-Non_002dStop">Remote Non-Stop</a>) and may be ignored by the stub otherwise. 
A stop reply should be generated for any affected thread not already stopped. 
When a thread is stopped by means of a `<samp><span class="samp">t</span></samp>' action,
the corresponding stop reply should indicate that the thread has stopped with
signal `<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>', regardless of whether the target uses some other signal
as an implementation detail.

     <p>The stub must support `<samp><span class="samp">vCont</span></samp>' if it reports support for
multiprocess extensions (see <a href="multiprocess-extensions.html#multiprocess-extensions">multiprocess extensions</a>).  Note that in

<var>addr</var> of type <var>kind</var>.

     <p>A memory breakpoint is implemented by replacing the instruction at
<var>addr</var> with a software breakpoint or trap instruction.  The
<var>kind</var> is target-specific and typically indicates the size of
the breakpoint in bytes that should be inserted.  E.g., the <span class="sc">arm</span>
and <span class="sc">mips</span> can insert either a 2 or 4 byte breakpoint.  Some
architectures have additional meanings for <var>kind</var>;
<var>cond_list</var> is an optional list of conditional expressions in bytecode
form that should be evaluated on the target's side.  These are the
conditions that should be taken into consideration when deciding if
the breakpoint trigger should be reported back to <var>GDBN</var>.

     <p>The <var>cond_list</var> parameter is comprised of a series of expressions,
concatenated without separators. Each expression has the following form:

          <dl>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">X </span><var>len</var><span class="samp">,</span><var>expr</var></samp>'<dd><var>len</var> is the length of the bytecode expression and <var>expr</var> is the
actual conditional expression in bytecode form.

     </dl>

     <p>The optional <var>cmd_list</var> parameter introduces commands that may be
run on the target, rather than being reported back to <span class="sc">gdb</span>. 
The parameter starts with a numeric flag <var>persist</var>; if the flag is
nonzero, then the breakpoint may remain active and the commands
continue to be run even when <span class="sc">gdb</span> disconnects from the target. 
Following this flag is a series of expressions concatenated with no
separators.  Each expression has the following form:

          <dl>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">X </span><var>len</var><span class="samp">,</span><var>expr</var></samp>'<dd><var>len</var> is the length of the bytecode expression and <var>expr</var> is the
actual conditional expression in bytecode form.

     <p><em>Implementation note: It is possible for a target to copy or move
code that contains memory breakpoints (e.g., when implementing
overlays).  The behavior of this packet, in the presence of such a
